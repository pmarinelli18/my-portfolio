			"description": "Social media can sometimes be a toxic environment. Without proper attention, friends and family can be consumed by the compiled negativity. This application aims to take a deeper look at the users emotions and personality while pointing out instances where they may not have been healthy in conversation. Look After tries to promote healthy conversation by providing a URL to the users messages. In development we used ASP.net MVC in combination with the Twitter API and the Google Natural Language Processing API. We also used multiple studies and datasets based on the big 5 personality traits and 6 emotions to analyze and interpret the data returned from the APIs.",

Because of the rapid nature of twitter, it can be hard for individuals to keep track of their friends when they need them the most.
